## Description
 As a programmer, I am constantly creating README files for my projects. This process can be tedious. I wanted to create a program that would generate a README file based on my input to expedite the process.

## Usage
 First, open the program in the terminal. Start the program using node index.js. Answer each question. Most require text input, but the checkbox allows for multiple options to be selected. This can be done by scrolling throughg ad pressing plus on the licenses that are applicable to your program. The generated README file will be created in the repository.
