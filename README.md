## Description
 A repository needs a quality README. Manually creating a README each time can be tedious. To expedite this process, I wanted to create a program that would generate the README for me. This program will generate a README.md file and populate it with input provided by the user.

## Usage
 This program needs to be run from the terminal. Run this program with the command node index.js. From there, the user needs to answer each prompt. Most questions require text input, and the user can type as much or as little as they like. The licenses are provided as a list and only one may be selected.

## Installation
 This program requires inquirer to run. Install inquirer with npm install.
